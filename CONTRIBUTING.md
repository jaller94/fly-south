## Keep it under 13 kilobytes
I might hesitate to apply changes, if the game size becomes over 13 kilobytes or includes new external libraries. The game was an entry in the js13k games jam, which restricts the allowed file size for an entry.

Even though the game jam is over, I would like to keep the game under 13 kilobytes. This excludes the external link to the A-Frame library.

## Consistent formatting
This repository contains a file called `.editorconfig`. The file format is described on https://editorconfig.org/. To have a consistent formatting of the code, I ask you to honor the settings.

There is a good chance that the text editor has an extension to adopt the formatting automatically. Please have a look.
